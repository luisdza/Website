What is R R is a programming language for statistical computing, data analysis and visualisation of data. R is free and open source. Learn more at (http://www.r-project.org/).

Secondly, this group intends to spread the use of R in South Africa and show others (also non-R users) the benefits of using R. Code of Conduct Our Code of Conduct can be found here (https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct) Connect with us We would like to hear how you use and enjoy the R language and statistical programming environment.
