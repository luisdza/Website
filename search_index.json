What is R R is a programming language for statistical computing, data analysis and visualisation of data. R is free and open source. Learn more at (http://www.r-project.org/). Our goals Our purpose is to bring R users together to help each other with common problems, exchange knowledge and share experiences. Secondly, this group intends to spread the use of R in South Africa and show others (also non-R users) the benefits of using R. R-Ladies As a diversity initiative, R-Ladies? mission is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies? primary focus, therefore, is on supporting the R enthusiasts who identify as an underrepresented minority to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide. There are 155 local groups spread across 46 countries, and two of those groups are in South Africa, Cape Town and Johannesburg. Code of Conduct Our Code of Conduct can be found here: R User Group R-Ladies Connect with us We would like to hear how you use and enjoy the R language and statistical programming environment.
