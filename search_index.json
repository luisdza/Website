What is R R is a programming language for statistical computing, data analysis and visualisation of data. R is free and open source. Learn more at (http://www.r-project.org/). Our goals Our purpose is to bring R users together to help each other with common problems, exchange knowledge and share experiences. Secondly, this group intends to spread the use of R in South Africa and show others (also non-R users) the benefits of using R. Code of Conduct Our Code of Conduct can be found here (https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct) Connect with us We would like to hear how you use and enjoy the R language and statistical programming environment. Find out more details of when we’re next meeting on our meetup page on Meetup.com. Slides and code from previous MeetUps can be found in our GitHub [repository].(https://github.com/rusergroupcoza/).
