# About

## Who are we
We are the R user groups in located in South Africa.

## What is R
R is a programming language for statistical computing, data analysis and visualisation of data. R is free and open source. Learn more at (http://www.r-project.org/).

## Our goals
- Our purpose is to bring R users together to help each other with common problems, exchange knowledge and share experiences.
- Secondly, this group intends to spread the use of R in South Africa and show others (also non-R users) the benefits of using R.

## Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct can be found here:
