# About

## Who are we
We are the local R user group in Johannesburg, South Africa.

## What is R
R is a programming language for statistical computing, data analysis and visualisation of data. R is free and open source. Learn more at (http://www.r-project.org/).

## Our goals
- Our purpose is to bring R users together to help each other with common problems, exchange knowledge and share experiences.
- Secondly, this group intends to spread the use of R in South Africa and show others (also non-R users) the benefits of using R.

## Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct can be found here (https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct)

## Connect with us
We would like to hear how you use and enjoy the R language and statistical programming environment.

Find out more details of when we're next meeting on our meetup page on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Joburg-R-Users-Group/).
